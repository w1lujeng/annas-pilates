# Anna's Pilates

 is a single page app, created with the following technologies

* Mongo
* Express
* React
* Node
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Heroku




## Anna Inuzuka

is a friend of mine who plays in many of the same groups as I do. She transitioned careers a few years ago, and I always found this inspiring.  

## Purpose of app

This was initially meant to be a workout tracker for pilates and a client management system for the administrator.  As of now, it is more of a personal website for Anna, with a pilates workout tracker. Users can learn about Anna, the practice of pilates, and keep tracke of their own workouts.  I have included a progress tracker that calculates a percentage of total workouts toward their goal-a hard coded 20 workouts for now.

This is a fully functional realworld(if simple) application. With a lot of workout I can see this as being a more commercial application. Especially if I can get Anna to pimp me out to her friends.

In the immediate future a plan on spin this off into a fully functional, single-purpose workout tracker.

## Unresolved issues

No unresolved issures at the moment of writing this document, but LOTS and LOTS of stuff I was unable to put in.

### For the administrator

* access to clients, with name, email, and picture
* communication from app in either email or DM form
* ability to accept appointments through the app
* more photos of equipment in use

### For a client

* ability to book appointments
* ability to DM site owner
* change workout goal, 20 a month is good, but it would be better to choose your own
* speaking of goals, I'd like it to reset every month



### For me

* develop into full-fledged workout tracker
* spinning app off to different instructors - come on Anna!
* spinning app into different areas

    * generic personal training
    * private music lessons
