    <h2>About Anna</h2>
      <p>
      Anna Inuzuka has always enjoyed the pursuit of strengthening the body and mind. She believes that keeping the body healthy and fit should be something you look forward to rather than dread. Her Pilates journey began in 2006. At the time Anna was pursuing a degree in French Horn performance at the Boston Conservatory and choose Pilates as a way to systematically strengthen the abdominals, control the breath, and improve posture, all of which would be beneficial to her as instrumentalist. Although Anna ultimately decided not to pursue a career in music, she continued to practice Pilates, deepening her knowledge and honing her skills over the years. In 2014 she began training to become a Pilates instructor under the esteemed Master Trainer Maria Leone at Balanced Body University. Anna become a Comprehensively Certified Pilates Instructor in 2015 and has been teaching full time ever since. She enjoys working with people of all different backgrounds and with a wide variety of goals, and she truly believes Pilates is for everyone! Anna loves to blend traditional exercises with contemporary variations and flows to enhance the workout and keep things fresh. She's takes inspiration from the people around her incorporating elements of dance, weightlifting, yoga, and functional movement.

  <h2>About Pilates</h2>
      <p>
      Pilates is a fitness system offering a full-body workout that both strengthens and stretches. Its creator, Joseph Pilates, originally called it "Contrology" because the practitioner must control each exercise by deeply connecting the mind and body. Each movement is performed with precision, breath, flow, and concentration, and with a strong emphasis on the core. Pilates is a truly scalable practice and is appropriate for elite athletes, those injured or disabled, pre/post-natal women, and everyone in between. Pilates can be performed on the mat using just one’s body, or it can utilize equipment such as the Reformer, Wunda Chair, Trapeze Table, Ladder Barrel, and Tower. Each piece of equipment has its own extensive repertoire, offering a nearly endless variety of exercises. A great Pilates workout will always leave you feeling stronger, balanced, energized, and lengthened.

  As Joe used to say:
  <blockquote>
  "In 10 sessions you'll feel the difference
  In 20 sessions you'll see the difference
  In 30 sessions you'll have a whole new body"
